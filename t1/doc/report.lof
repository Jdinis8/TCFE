It consists, essentially, in a circuit with 4 essential meshes, 8 nodes and 11 branches (in which we count 7 resistors, 2 voltage sources - one of them controlled by the current $I_C$ - and 2 current sources - one independent and one dependent, controlled by the voltage $V_b$ as it can be seen in the figure.
