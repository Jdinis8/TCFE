Once the linear approximation for the transistors were the version with the capacitors the shape of the curves are similar but there are still differences, specifically the theoretical analysis predicts an gain voltage in dB of above 40 as the simulation predicts slightly bellow 40. The other considerable difference is for the higher frequency that both expect very low gains but the simulation analysis decreases faster.

Between the gain stage and the output stage the signal maintains the shift for above 40 in the theoretical analysis, but the difference for the higher frequencies seems to be attenuated. This is to be expected but

The differences in the gain and in the input impedance cannot be ignored. These may come from the approximations done in the  theoretical analysis when we totally ignore the capacitors contribution. Furthermore, we also use a 8x8 matrix, which might easily introduce numerical errors. Thus, because the rest of the values are around the same magnitude, we feel that it is a good result overall, given the nonlinear aspect of the transistor. One last comment, because our OP, although sufficient for us to be working in the FAR, is close to $V_{beon}$ (it is so in order to increase our merit), which might make the transistor, in the Ngspice model, to start to behave differently than from our analysis through Octave.
